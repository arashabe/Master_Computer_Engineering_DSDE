### [Design, Algorithms, and Computability](https://unibg.coursecatalogue.cineca.it/insegnamenti/2024/38090-MOD1/2021/8865/89?coorte=2024&schemaid=77076&adCodRadice=38090)


#### Course Description
The course covers comprehensive design and analysis methodologies, including both large-scale and small-scale system designs. Large-scale design focuses on subdividing software into functional components and ensuring efficient data exchange via APIs in distributed environments, covering topics such as agile development, requirement management, UML-based design, software architecture quality analysis, advanced design patterns, and object-oriented development for desktop and mobile applications. In contrast, small-scale design delves into the detailed analysis and definition of individual components and algorithms, addressing algorithms and data structures, computational complexity, Java implementation, sorting algorithms, tree and graph management, and algorithm design methodologies. Additionally, the course explores the theory of computability, encompassing fundamental concepts, theorems, and Turing machines.

#### Project
A web app designed to facilitate communication and collaboration among university students. Users can register, log in, update their profiles, and send notifications to form study groups based on common interests. The system does not directly manage students but allows them to interact and organize themselves into study groups autonomously. The app follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to separate concerns and enhance maintainability.

**Technologies Used:** Spring Boot, Spring Security, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, H2 Database, JUnit, Playwright, Postman, Maven.

### [Database 2](https://unibg.coursecatalogue.cineca.it/insegnamenti/2024/8244_43613_12905/2021/8244/89?coorte=2023&schemaid=77316)

#### Course Description
During the Database 2 course, we delved into numerous topics, including Transactional Systems, Internal Architecture of a Relational Server, Distributed and Parallel Architectures, Active Databases, and XML Databases.

#### Project
The project focuses on active databases, Event/Condition/Action (ECA) rules, and the integration of XML data with relational databases. The project revolves around analyzing a COVID-19 clinical studies dataset from Kaggle, which contains over 5000 XML files. Each file represents a study, with details such as title, sponsor/collaborators, status, start and completion dates, and other metadata.

The goal of this project is to design and implement a database system that leverages SQL Server, XML storage, and advanced querying techniques such as XQuery to automate data extraction, maintenance, and updates. This aligns with the concepts learned in the course, specifically focusing on triggers, active rules, and XML data processing in relational databases.

**Technologies Used:** SQL Server, BaseX, XQuery, Triggers, Stored Procedures.

### [Formal Languages and Compilers](https://unibg.coursecatalogue.cineca.it/insegnamenti/2023/3212_35538_10011/2021/3212/89?coorte=2022&schemaid=68842)

#### Course Description
In the Formal Languages and Compilers course, we explored a wide range of fundamental theoretical and practical concepts for understanding and implementing programming languages and compilers. The main topics of the course include:

- **Basic Concepts:** Introduction to alphabets, strings, languages, and operations on them.
- **Regular Expressions and Languages:** Study of regular expressions, their composition rules, and the properties of regular languages.
- **Finite State Automata:** Exploration of deterministic (DFA) and non-deterministic (NFA) automata, including those with Îµ-moves.
- **BNF (Backus-Naur Form) Grammars:** Analysis of formal grammars, derivation, parse tree construction, and parsing techniques such as LL(1), LR(0), and LALR(1).


#### Project
This project aims to create a code analyzer capable of detecting lexical, syntactic, and semantic errors in a simple programming language using a custom Java-like grammar.

The grammar, while not complete, was designed to explore the capabilities of ANTLR4 and demonstrate how to bridge theoretical concepts with practical applications. The project aims to showcase the process of building a lexer and parser for a Java-like language, integrating these components with a PyQt5-based user interface to allow interactive analysis of code.

The analyzer uses ANTLR4 to generate the lexer and parser, while the user interface (GUI) is built using PyQt5, providing a platform to visualize and correct errors in the source code.

The application allows users to:
- Perform tokenization of source code through a lexer generated by ANTLR.
- Analyze the syntactic structure of the code with a parser and create a syntax tree.
- Conduct semantic checks on the code using a visitor pattern to verify the validity of declarations and operations.
- Provide an interactive graphical interface to load code, view errors, and easily correct them.

**Technologies Used:** Python 3.x, PyQt5, ANTLR4
